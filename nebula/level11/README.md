The program executes the command obtained after process() algorithm.
In order to get reproducible output, a null terminated string is better.

level11_debunk.c tries combination of three symbols in [a-Z][0-9] and prints out the ones that results in a null terminated string.

(1 symbol is not long enough for a symbol and null termination, two symbols could be enough, but I found no combination working)

"AAA" is such a combination. The idea was to feed the program with it, and found which command it was invoking, and have a link point to /bin/getflag.
Unfortunetaly, the call to fread is buggy, and no more than 1 symbol is accepted.

Sticking with 1 length long:

Content-Length: 1

e

results in calls to dxxxx depending of memory state, until a 0x00 byte is found.
With several runs, you eventually get a call to "d" alone. With a PATH starting with current directory, and a sym link d pointing to /bin/getflag, getflag is called.
But it does not gives the flag :-( WTF ?
